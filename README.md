# ASCII Image Generator
Small project of mine i did last night that takes an image u choose and turns it into a bunch of numbers or characters of ur choice. Pointless ik but really fun to use in my opinion

# Some images

# How to use
* Its really easy to use as if u know how to use VS Code and know how to run python then ur all set.
* For those who dont know how to run it, just take the code, copy it or download the file, and put it into VS Code then open a terminal and type in "python love.py" u can change the file name if u want but make sure to replace love.py in the command to urfilename.py. After that u should see a window pop up with a bunch of stuff that explain themselfs, for now speed and morph is being worked on as they will be used to morph the 1s and 0s or the other characters into the picture with a cool animation and such.

# How do the options work?
Very simple, Open Image opens ur file explorer so u can choose an image u want to use, Scale is also easy the higher the number the less characters and detail it does and the lower the number the more characters and details it does (do be warned anything below 1 can lag out ur system due the the tramendous ammount of characters its rendering), Charset is also self explained as its where u choose wether to use 01s or 123456789s or symbols like #@$%&*, lastly Colored Mode is also simple as u choose wether it should be colored or not.

# Some more images as well as a video
